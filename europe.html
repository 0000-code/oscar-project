                <p>Three Valleys Ski Resort was originally established in 1938 by British ski enthusiast Peter Lindsay,
                    who
                    built the first ropeway in the same year. Meribel is the geographical centre of the entire three
                    canyons, with Courchevel and La Tania to the east and Val Thorens to the west. Meribel has beautiful
                    "Chalet" style buildings surrounded by woods and a very festive atmosphere within the resort. </p>
